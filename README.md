Hi there I'm Ivan and I graduated from Cal State Monterey Bay in 2020. My degree encompassed software development life cycles, development patterns like test driven or behavior driven development, data structures and algorithms, SQL and databases, and web development.

I absolutely love working in the Flutter framework but can hold my own in a VueJS environment. I also have experience developing back-end web APIs with Java's SpringBoot and Javascript's node/express.

In my free time I love to garden and play video games.

I would love to collaborate with you in any open source project, you can reach me at ivan.alejandre@gmail.com
